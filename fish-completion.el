;;; Commentary:
;; You can setup this package globally with:
;;
;; (when (and (executable-find "fish")
;;            (require 'fish-completion nil t))
;;   (global-fish-completion-mode))
;;
;; Alternatively, you can call the `fish-completion-mode' manually or in shell /
;; Eshell mode hook.
;;
;; The package `bash-completion' is an optional dependency: if available,
;; `fish-completion-complete' can be configured to fall back on bash to further
;; try completing.  See `fish-completion-fallback-on-bash-p'.

;;; Bugs:
;; If the fish user config changes directory on startup, file completion will
;; not be right.  One work-around is to add a "cd default-directory" before the
;; "complete", but that's brittle because of unreliable shell escaping.
;; Upstream does not allow for skipping the user config:
;; https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4165.
